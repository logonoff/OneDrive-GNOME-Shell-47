# OneDrive GNOME Shell Extension

This is a GNOME Shell extension I use as frontend for the unofficial abraunegg OneDrive client (https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive) on my desktop.

This extension is forked from [dvmasterfx](https://github.com/dvmasterfx/Onedrive-Gnome-Shell-45) who in turn forked in from (diegstroyer)[https://github.com/diegstroyer/oneDrive], who forked it from (Diego Bazzanella)[https://github.com/dbazza/oneDrive].

**This extension is not affiliated, funded, or in any way associated with Microsoft and OneDrive.**

# Features

The OneDrive GNOME Shell Extension can:

- check that `systemctl` and `onedrive` are installed;
- start and stop `oneddrive` as user service;
- show the status of abraunegg's `onedrive` service;
- show the process of abraunegg's `onedrive` service;
- show an icon on the system tray
- show the OneDrive local folder;
- show emblems on OneDrive local folder;
- open the OneDrive website;
- perform authentication via command line;

# Install

Install the client. Detailed instructions here: https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md. If you have Ubuntu installed take a look at [this advise](https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md#important-information-for-all-ubuntu-and-ubuntu-based-distribution-users).

Go to the [GNOME Shell Extensions page](https://extensions.gnome.org/), search for "OneDrive Client" and install it. You have to login and activate the `onedrive` service via the extension. That's all!
